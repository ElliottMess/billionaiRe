The goal of billionaiRe is to provide an easy interface for using long format
data to calculate the World Health Organization's Triple Billions.

## Installation

You can install billionaiRe from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```  r
remotes::install_github("gpw13/billionaiRe", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You will need to have already installed the wppdistro package, which is stored in
a private repo and only made public upon request. Please contact caldwellst@who.int
to request access.

# Calculations

The package is built around a set of functions that calculate the Billions
for the three Billions separately:

* Healthier Populations (HPOP)
* Health Emergencies Protection (HEP)
* Universal Health Coverage (UHC)

## HPOP Billion calculation

```{r child='vignettes/hpop.rmd'}
```

## UHC Billion calculation

```{r child='vignettes/uhc.rmd'}
```

## HEP Billion calculation

```{r child='vignettes/hep.rmd'}
```
